# Problem 15
# Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner. How many such routes are there through a 20 x 20 grid?

# For the 2 x 2 grid, note that path must travel down exactly twice and right exactly twice. We then ask how many ways we can order these two ups and two downs. 
# If we number the moves (1, 2, 3, 4), we could simply say, "Pick two numbers to be the right move. How many combinations of numbers can you pick?"
# This turns the 2 x 2 problem into 4 choose 2. This framing generalizes to higher grid sizes (including non-square grids) and renders the 20 x 20 problem as simply calculating 40 choose 20.
